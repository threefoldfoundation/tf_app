    Document Version 1.1
</div>

<div>
    <p>This Investment Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the <b>“Agreemeent“</b>) is entered into on <b>{{ effective_date }}</b> (the <b>“Effective Date“</b>), by and between:</p>
    <p><b>Investor</b>,</p>
    <p><b>{{ full_name }}</b>,</p>
    <p>residing at <b>{{ address }}</b>;,</p>
    <p>hereinafter referred to as the “<b>Investor</b>”;</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p><b>BetterToken BVBA</b>, a limited liability company with registered office at Antwerpsesteenweg 19, 9080 Lochristi, Belgium, and
        registered with the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises under company number BE 0666.708.318 (RPR Gent); hereinafter referred
        to as the “<b>Company</b>”;</p>
    <p>Collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “<b>Parties</b>”, each referred to as a “<b>Party</b>”.</p>

    <p><b>WHEREAS</b></p>
    <p>Before its Public Token Offering (PTO), the Threefold Foundation is launching an Internal Token Offering (ITO) for friends, family
        and ambassadors. This ITO will be structured as a loan note issued by the Company which is convertible into ThreeFold Tokens
        pursuant to the terms and conditions of the present Agreement.</p>

    <p><b>THEREFORE, IT HAS BEEN AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</b></p>
    <p><b>1. Amount</b></p>
    <p>The Investor will make available to the Company a principal amount of <b>{{ amount }}</b> {{ currency_full }} (<b>{{ amount }}</b> {{ currency_short }}) as a convertible loan (the “<b>Loan</b>”).</p>
    <p>The Loan will be paid by the Investor by wire transfer to the Company’s ING bank account; IBAN: BE89363032208585; BIC BBRUBEBB within 3 business days as from the date of this agreement.</p>
    <p>The Company undertakes to use the Loan in view of executing its Business Plan.</p>
    <p><b>2. Term of the Agreement – Conversion – Redemption</b></p>
    <p>On the occurrence of the ThreeFold Foundation’s Public Token Offering (“PTO”), the Company shall convert the unpaid principal
        amount of the Loan and any accrued interests into ThreeFold Tokens at a discount of 50% (fifty percent) of the Token price
        achieved on the closing of ThreeFold’s PTO. The total convertible amount will be rounded down to the nearest corresponding
        multiple of the discounted Threefold Token Price. The balance (if any) will be repaid to the Investor.</p>
    <p>The capital of the loan and any accrued interests will in any event either be redeemed or converted within one year as from the Effective Date (the “<b>Redemption Date</b>” or “<b>Conversion Date</b>”).</p>
    <p><b>3. Interest</b></p>
    <p>The Investor is entitled to an interest payment of 2% (two per cent) per year on the outstanding capital, starting as from the
        Effective Date. Interests are capitalized at the Conversion Date or Redemption Date.</p>
    <p>Interest payments are made together with the redemption of the capital of the Loan or the conversion of the Loan.</p>
    <p>In the event a (pre-) payment or conversion takes place, the interest payments are calculated on a pro rata temporis basis.</p>
    <p><b>4. Lock-up Period</b></p>
    <p>Without consent from the Foundation, Internal Token Offering investors will not be allowed to sell their Tokens for a period of six months after the date of this Agreement..</p>
    <p><b>5. Default</b></p>
    <p>The Investor may terminate the loan forthwith and without any prior written notice in case of any of the following events, which will each constitute an “Event of Default” by the Company:</p>
    <ol class="ol-alpha">
      <li>the appointment of a receiver over any material part of the assets or undertakings of the Company, which results in a
          suspension of payments, or an attachment (“beslag”) being made on a material part of the Company’s assets or undertakings, or
          any bankruptcy, insolvency, judicial reorganization or similar legal action instituted by or against the Company; or</li>
      <li>the occurrence of any other event which would have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s ability to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Upon an Event of Default, the Investor may, at any time thereafter, by notice to the Company, declare that the Loan together with
        accrued interest and all amounts payable under the Loan by the Company are immediately due and payable.</p>
    <p><b>6. Withholding</b></p>
    <p>If the Company, in accordance with applicable tax law, is obliged to retain a withholding or any other similar tax or deduction on
        the payment of interest or the repayment of the principal amount under the Loan, the Company will immediately notify the
        Investor, withhold the applicable tax, pay this tax to the competent authorities before any penalties or interests are due and pay
        the remaining amount to the Investor. If the Investor has to pay the above-mentioned withholding tax or penalties or interests in
        connection therewith, due to a fault or negligence of the Company, the Company will reimburse the Investor upon first request
        for the damages suffered. If the Company pays the above-mentioned withholding tax or penalties or interests connected
        therewith, it will provide the Investor with the official tax receipts evidencing the payment, or certified copies thereof, as soon as it has received them.</p>
    <p><b>7. Assignment</b></p>
    <p>The Investor agrees that the Company may assign the Agreement in its discretion provided notice of such assignment is provided within 15 days thereof.
    <p><b>8. Amendments</b></p>
    <p>No amendment modifying, adding to or omitting from, or terminating this Agreement will be binding upon a Party unless made in writing and signed by or in the name of the Parties involved.
    <p><b>9. Partial Invalidity</b></p>
    <p>The nullity of one of the provisions of this Agreement shall have no bearing on the validity of the other provision of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>In such case the Parties to this Agreement shall in good faith negotiate on the provisions of this Agreement so that the same
        economic balance between the rights and obligations of the Parties to this Agreement are safeguarded to the same extent as if
        the invalid provision had been valid.</p>
    <p><b>10. Governing Law</b></p>
    <p>This Agreement is subject to Belgian law.</p>
    <p><b>11. Jurisdiction</b></p>
    <p>Any dispute which may arise between the Parties in relation to the validity, the interpretation or the execution of this Agreement will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Gent, Belgium.</p>
    <p>Signed in ______________ [PLACE] on ___________ [DATE], in two originals, each of the Parties acknowledging having received one original.</p>
